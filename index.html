		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi! My name is Siddharth Korivi (Siddhu for short), and I'm 9 years old (I know that sounds crazy but it's true). I've got a sister (who's a <i>really</i> naughty little girl) and  a mum and dad who are both working (they told me to make this blog to keep me busy). My sister's name is Haasini (Happy if you translate it) , my mum's name is Haritha, and my dad's name is Chandrashekhar. Together we make the Korivi family (excluding my mum).<br><br> I'm in Year 4 and I go to Parsonage Farm School (if you know where that is). My sister's just joined our school (she used to go to Abb's Cross Nursery before), and I just <i>can't</i> stop thinking of the mayhem she'll cause (I pity her classmates). My dad's a developer and my mum's a QA tester, so it <i>kind</i> of runs in the family. My top 3 interests are Games, Tech and Books.<br> I'll see you in the next chapters!!
